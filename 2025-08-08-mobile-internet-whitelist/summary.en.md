**Key points:**
- Attack vector remains; whitelist is easy to bypass.
- CAPTCHA is for control, not cybersecurity.
- Consequences: slower speeds, higher latency, work tools inaccessible.
- No real benefit against drones or DDoS.
- Motives: control, identification, political use, preparation for Runet segmentation.
